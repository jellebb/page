I am interested in questions about agency and control. Behavior is not determined by the environment, nor is it imbued by some internal agent. How intentional and adequate actions can arise out of the interplay between brain, body and environment is one of the central questions of my research. 

I studied Physics and Astronomy (BSc.), Philosophy (BA./MA.) and Brain and Cognitive Sciences (MSc.) at the University of Amsterdam, after which I pursued a PhD with [Erik Rietveld](https://erikrietveld.com/) on *Naturalizing Skilled Intentionality*. I successfully defended my [dissertation](https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=75672790-f4ac-4b84-bde7-83b51ccc73bb) in Spring 2018.

I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation ([ILLC](https://illc.uva.nl)) funded by an [Amsterdam Brain and Cognition](https://abc.uva.nl) Talent Grant. I am also an Associate Fellow at the UvA's [Institute for Advanced Studies](https://ias.uva.nl).
